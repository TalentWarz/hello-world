				<p style="margin-right:45px;text-align:left;">
				I'm Justin, founder and creator of Talent Warz. This website has been my passion since 2012 and 
				I'm excited to finally start giving others a chance to follow their dreams. My understanding 
				of Talent Warz has grown tremendously over the years and it's taught me a lot about myself. I am
				motivated and excited to see her breathing.

				<text style="float:left;">Thank you!</text>

			<section class="about_left">
				<h1 class="about_h1">What is Talent Warz?</h1>
				<p class="about_p">Talent Warz is a chance for those who seek to be a star but don't have the money, time, knowledge or network to get there. It's a place where artists and entertainers meet discoverability, exposure and motivation to do what they love. Quite honestly, Talent Warz is a short cut to fame, for those who have what it takes.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="about_right">
				<h1 class="about_h1">How?</h1>
				<p class="about_p">With a head to head video vs video algorithm that determines Rank and Skill Level between competitors. The higher you rank, the more visibility your profile will have for all the Talent Warz fans to discover. There's more to it below.</p>
			</section>	
			<section class="about_left">
				<h1 class="about_h1">What's the problem?</h1>
				<p class="about_p">The problem is simple. Even if you're the best at what you do, it's not easy finding fame. Let's pretend you're the world's next top star but currently no one knows who you are. Unless you get lucky, uploading a video to your facebook page will likely result in getting the same number of "Likes" as always.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="about_right">
				<p class="about_p">Another example is youtube. More factors exist in getting big on youtube than one may think. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is one of them. While there are ways to learn it, SEO takes time to master and is a crucial part of getting found in google/youtube searches. Marketing yourself is another piece of the puzzle with the cost of money, time, & knowledge.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="about_left">
				<p class="about_p">These examples are few of the many problems that exist for those who pursue a passion in the entertainment industry.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="about_right">
				<h1 class="about_h1">Solution</h1>
				<p class="about_p">What if the only thing that mattered was how good you are at what you do? (Rather than who you know, what you know, and how much money you've got)</p>
			</section>
			<section class="about_right">
				<p class="about_p">Let pretend again you're a top star and you've earned the number one seat on Talent Warz because, well, you're the best. This is where Talent Warz will introduce our ENTIRE TRAFFIC FEED to your profile page, promoting your website, itunes, twitter and any other links you choose to display.</p>
				<p class="about_p">Now let's say you've earned our number two seat. You're probably going to get a little less traffic than number one but you're likely to get more than our number three seat. This concept continues down the ranks. Basically, the better you place in our ranking system the more traffic you will get.</p>
				<p class="about_p">Sure, a ton of free traffic sounds great for deserving artists, but that's not enough for Talent Warz. Keep reading :)</p>
			</section>
			<section class="about_left">	
				<h1 class="about_h1">Why use Talent Warz?</h1>
				<ul>
					<li>It's free</li>
					<li>Mobile</li>
					<li>Can introduce top talent to top record labels, etc.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="about_p">Many people have asked, "How will you introduce top singers to leading record labels"? My answer is, they will come to us. I'll explain.</p>
				<p class="about_p">When Talent Warz has enough traction (or traffic), it will attract the attention of top record labels. It really is that simple. Just like other users, record labels can explore the rankings to discover wanted talent.</p>
			</section>
			<section class="about_right">
				<h1 class="about_h1">Current situation?</h1>
				<p class="about_p">I am proud to see how far Talent Warz has come, but the truth is this is just the beginning. The website is finally functioning correctly and now it's time to get it out there. This is where you come in.</p>
